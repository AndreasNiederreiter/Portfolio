		<p class="single-sub">For a pen and paper I'm currently writing, I made the following concept art of the Weary Count. The players belong to an elite combat unit riding dragons and thus become embroiled in a national conflict, in which they must decide which side to support (if any). On their journey they meet the Weary Count, who administers a region that plays a significant role in this conflict. He works tirelessly because his position depends on the outcome of the conflict.</p>
