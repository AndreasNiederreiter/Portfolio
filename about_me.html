				<p class="about-text">Ever since I was little, Videogames have captivated me.

It started as a way to pass time and entertain myself, but with time my interest for storytelling and the medium itself began to grew. It didn't matter if it was games like "The Last of Us Part 2" which deeply moved me with it's complex character dynamics and parallels and sparked my interest in the reasons behind why certain narratives are chosen or simply informing myself about how doors work in video games, everything fascinated me.

Then I began to try out by myself. First with the ressources possible I had at the time: I drew, tried to build Adventure Maps in Minecraft and wrote Pen and Paper's. The latter in particular gave me what I find most exciting about video games: to create a story, do worldbuilding, make concept arts, think about possible mechanics and the free interaction of the players with the story and the world.

As I got older I had the technical possibilities to get involved in game development: I tried out my first projects in Unreal Engine and discovered digital art for myself in the process. The decision to pursue a career in this field after graduating from academic secondary school was therefore a conscious one.

Here at university and at different Game Jams I realized that I'm good at developing games with other people and that I really enjoy the process.</p>
